    "summary": "Completed comprehensive backend testing of real-time overage billing implementation. All 7 API endpoint tests and 7 implementation verification checks passed successfully (100% success rate). Verified that overage billing now happens immediately on call_ended webhook instead of 5-minute Celery polling, with proper integration and system stability.",
