<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** 
1.  Set up the provided Django-based Telegram Bot codebase.
2.  Analyze the codebase in the pod and compare it with the one at  to determine if one is more updated.
3.  The user now wants to integrate a new voice provider, Quo. The task is to analyze how to power the voice features with Quo, how it can work in a multi-tenant setup, and document the findings.
    -   **Provider Doc:** 
    -   **API Key:** 

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A fully operational Django-based Telegram Bot application for IVR management. The environment has been set up with PostgreSQL and Redis, all dependencies are installed, database migrations are complete, and initial data has been seeded. The codebase has been verified to be identical to the provided GitHub repository.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The agent began the analysis for integrating the Quo voice provider as requested by the user. It was tasked with understanding how to replace the existing voice functionality, implement multi-tenancy, and document the process. The first step taken was to call the  tool to gather information and a plan for the Quo API.
*   **Status:** NOT STARTED
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** both
*   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending issues. The initial setup was completed successfully.

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1**: Analyze Quo Voice Provider Integration
    *   **Where to resume**: The next step is to receive and analyze the observation from the  tool call. This will provide the strategy for integrating Quo.
    *   **What will be achieved with this?**: A clear understanding and plan for integrating Quo for voice capabilities and enabling multi-tenancy in the application.
    *   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: backend
    *   **Blocked on something**: Waiting for the  tool response.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **P0: Implement Quo Voice Integration:** Based on the analysis, modify the backend code (likely starting in  and ) to use the Quo API for voice call functionalities, replacing the existing Bland.ai integration.
    *   **P0: Implement Multi-tenancy:** This is a major architectural change. It will involve:
        *   Modifying database models (e.g., in , , ) to associate all data (users, calls, campaigns, payments, etc.) with a specific tenant or organization.
        *   Updating all database queries and business logic throughout the application to enforce tenant isolation.
    *   **P1: Document the Integration:** Create technical documentation detailing the Quo integration, multi-tenancy architecture, and any new environment variables or setup steps required.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full Application Setup:** Successfully set up the Django, PostgreSQL, and Redis environment for the Telegram bot project.
- **Dependency Installation:** Installed all Python dependencies from .
- **Database Initialization:** Ran all Django migrations and seeded the database with initial subscription plan data using .
- **Startup Bug Fix:** Resolved a critical startup issue in  where the application would crash if the Telegram API token was invalid. A  block was added to allow the server to start for setup and migrations.
- **Codebase Verification:** Performed a detailed file-by-file comparison between the code in the pod and the  GitHub repository, confirming they are the same version.
- **PRD Creation**: A  file was created at  to document the project requirements and progress.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**
The project is a monolithic Django application with a standard structure:


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Backend:** Django
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **Task Queue:** Celery (or a similar library like Huey, as seen in )
*   **Caching/Broker:** Redis
*   **Primary Interface:** Telegram Bot API

**key DB schema**
*   **bot.models**: , , , , , , , ,  and more, forming the core logic.
*   **payment.models**: , , , .
*   **user.models**:  (standard Django user model).

**changes in tech stack**
None in this session.

**All files of reference**
*   : Modified to add a  block to prevent a crash on startup if the Telegram token is invalid.
*   : Contains the current voice integration logic (Bland.ai) and is the likely starting point for the new Quo integration.
*   : Contains Celery tasks related to calls and campaigns, which will need modification for the Quo integration.
*   , , : These files will require significant changes to implement multi-tenancy.
*   : Created from  to manage secrets.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
The upcoming multi-tenancy task will require a significant refactoring of data access patterns across the entire application to ensure data is properly scoped to each tenant.

**key api endpoints**
The primary interaction is via the Telegram Bot API. The application also exposes webhooks:
*   : Webhook for processing payment notifications from DynoPay.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   The project is a Django/PostgreSQL application, not the default React/FastAPI stack.
*   A crucial fix was made in  to allow the server to start without a valid Telegram API token. Do not remove the  block there.
*   The immediate goal is to analyze and then implement a new voice provider (Quo) and introduce a multi-tenant architecture. This will be a significant architectural change.
*   The user has provided an API key for Quo.

**documents and test reports created in this job**

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User (Latest):** Requested analysis on integrating Quo for voice, making it multi-tenant, and documenting the process. Provided an API key and documentation link. (In Progress)
2.  **Agent:** Provided a detailed report confirming the pod and GitHub codebases are identical. (Completed)
3.  **User:** Asked the agent to analyze the provided GitHub repo and compare it to the current codebase. (Completed)
4.  **Agent:** Confirmed everything is set up and running and created a summary. (Completed)

**Project Health Check:**
*   **Working:** The entire application is set up and runnable.
*   **Broken:** None.
*   **Mocked:** None.

**3rd Party Integrations**
*   **Telegram Bot API:** Core interface for the application.
*   **PostgreSQL:** Primary database.

*   **Celery / Huey:** Asynchronous task processing.
*   **DynoPay:** Payment processing (requires User API key).
*   **Bland.ai:** Existing voice provider (requires User API key).
*   **Quo:** The new voice provider to be integrated (requires User API key - provided by user).

None of these integrations use the Emergent LLM Key.

**Testing status**
*   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
*   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
*   **Test files created:** []
